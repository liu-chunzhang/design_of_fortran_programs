# design_of_fortran_programs
本仓库是个人在学习Fortran语言时，以Stephen J. Chapman著，王志强、李浩亮等人译《Fortran程序设计》（第四版）为教材下建立的。
This repository was created based on "Fortran for Scientists & Engineers" (4th Edition), written by Stephen J. Chapman and translated by Zhiqiang Wang, Haoliang Li and others, when I learnt Fortran.
我针对本书内容进行学习，并尝试对其未给出参考答案的习题均一一做了解答（凡需要之处，均编写了相应的fortran练习程序）及撰写了勘误汇总。
I studied its content, tried to answer all exercises without reference answers (where necessary, I wrote corresponding Fortran programs) and wrote a summary of errata.
Fortran语言的学习者可以本仓库内容作为参考，如有问题可联系我，邮箱为shuangchengxue@gmail.com。
Fortran learners can use this repository as a reference. And if you have any questions, please contact me at shuangchengxue@gmail.com.
